# Django file form

**Django-file-form** helps you to write forms with a pretty ajax upload.

Features:

* You can easily add an ajax file-upload to a form.
* The ajax upload works the same as an html upload.
    * This means that you don't have to change your code to support ajax upload.
* Supports single and multiple file upload.

The project is hosted on [github](https://github.com/mbraak/django-file-form).

Works with Django 2.0 - 3.0. Also with Python 3.6 - 3.8

Older versions:
* 1.0.1 uses fine uploader for the javascript part
* 0.5.0 supports Django 1.11 and Python 2.

Version 2.0 has changed: see 'Upgrade from version 1.0' below, if you're upgrading from version 1.0 (or lower).

## Usage

**1 Install django-file-form**

```
pip install django-file-form
```

**2 Add the apps to your INSTALLED_APPS**

You must include 'django_file_form'

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django_file_form',
]
```

**3 Add the app to your urls**

In this example we use the url **upload/**. You can use a different url if you like.

```python
urlpatterns = patterns(
    '',
    url(r'^upload/', include('django_file_form.urls')),
)
```

**4 Add FileFormMixin to your form**

```python
from django_file_form.forms import FileFormMixin

class ExampleForm(FileFormMixin, forms.Form):
    pass
```

**5 Add a UploadedFileField**

```python
from django_file_form.forms import FileFormMixin, UploadedFileField

class ExampleForm(FileFormMixin, forms.Form):
    input_file = UploadedFileField()
```

**6 Include javascript and css in your template**

<script src="{% static "file_form/file_form.js" %}"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static "file_form/file_form.css" %}">
```

**7 Call the initUploadFields javascript function**

```html
<form id="example-form" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form }}
</form>

<script>
   $(function() {
       initUploadFields($('#example-form'));
   });
</script>
```

If your form has a prefix, then call `initUploadFields` as follows:

```js
  // for example, with prefix 'abc'
  initUploadFields($('#example-form'), { prefix: 'abc' });
```

See the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/forms/api/#prefixes-for-forms) for more information about form prefixes.

**8 Include the upload_template.html in your template**

```html
{% include 'django_file_form/upload_template.html' %}
```

**9 Handle uploaded files**

```python
class ExampleFormView(generic.FormView):
    template_name = 'example_form.html'
    form_class = forms.ExampleForm

    def form_valid(self, form):
        input_file = form.cleaned_data['input_file']

        return super(ExampleFormView, self).form_valid(form)
```

**10 Delete temporary files**

```python
class ExampleFormView(generic.FormView):
    template_name = 'example_form.html'
    form_class = forms.ExampleForm

    def form_valid(self, form):
        input_file = form.cleaned_data['input_file']

        form.delete_temporary_files()

        return super(ExampleFormView, self).form_valid(form)
```

**11 Include hidden fields**

Include hidden form fields in your template:

```python
{% for hidden in form.hidden_fields %}
    {{ hidden }}
{% endfor %}
```

NB: it's possible that the hidden fields are already included; for example if you use ``form.as_p``. Do not include the hidden fields twice.

Also see the testproject in the repository.

## Upgrade from version 1.0 (to 2.0)

* Add reference to file_form/file_form.css:
  * `<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static "file_form/file_form.css" %}">`
* Remove `django_file_form.ajaxuploader` from `INSTALLED_APPS` in your settings
* Remove reference to `ajaxuploader/js/fileuploader.js` in your template
* Remove reference to `ajaxuploader/css/fileuploader.css` in your template
* You don't have to include jquery; the fileuploader doesn't use it
* The setting `FILE_FORM_UPLOAD_BACKEND` is removed
* If you use custom css, you might have to change it.
  * The html uses the prefix `dff` now.

## Settings

Settings in `settings.py`:

* **FILE_FORM_MUST_LOGIN** (True / False):
  * Must the user be logged in to upload a file.
  * The default is `False`.

* **FILE_FORM_UPLOAD_DIR** (string):
  * The directory for the temporary uploads.
  * The setting is not full path, but must be a subdirectory of `MEDIA_ROOT`.
  * The default is `temp_uploads`.

* **FILE_FORM_FILE_STORAGE** (string):
  * The class that is used to store the temporary uploads.
  * The default is `django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage`.
