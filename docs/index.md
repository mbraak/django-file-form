# Django file form

**Django-file-form** helps you to write forms with a pretty ajax upload.

Features:

* You can easily add an ajax file-upload to a form.
* The ajax upload works the same as an html upload.
    * This means that you don't have to change your code to support ajax upload.
* Supports single and multiple file upload.
* Supports edition of uploaded files.
* Supports upload directly to AWS S3 compatible storages.
* Supports frontend events for the addition and removal of files.
* Supports addition of arbitrary file meta data and related widgets.

The project is hosted on [github](https://github.com/mbraak/django-file-form).

Works with Django 2.2 - 3.2. Also with Python 3.6 - 3.9

* Django-file-form 1.0.1 uses fine uploader for the javascript part
* Django-file-form 0.5.0 supports Django 1.11 and Python 2.
